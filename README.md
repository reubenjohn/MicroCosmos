# MicroCosmos
Fun little Unity evolution simulator.


TODO
---
 - ~~Divine intervention to recycle fat~~
 - Include chemical blobs in save
 - Flagella:
   - ~~Force scales with mass~~
   - Display flagella as corona (thickness indicates relative power)
 - Membrane:
   - Display membrane as disk inside cell (thickness indicates relative mass)
 - Chemical pump:
   - Flow rate is governed by mass of chemical pump substance and indicated by width of pump
   - Absolute membrane thickness limits pump speed
   - Maintaining relative mass of pump is an involuntary reaction
 - Ability for cells to ingest substances from the environment using it's orifice
 - Ability for cells to sense other cells
   - ~~Mass by substance~~
   - ~~Distance~~
   - Incoming velocity
   - Degree of separation (genealogically speaking)
   - Cost of sensor is proportional to range
   - Inter-cell communication signals (3 channels visualized a RGB)
 - Ability for cells to sense nearby substances
   - ~~Mass by substance~~
   - Cost of sensor is proportional to range
   - Cost of sensor is proportional to number of substances
 - Ability for cells to sense obstacles
 - Bigger brains
 - Egg laying
 - Saprotrophs
 - Murder
   - Stab
   - Drop poison
 - Plot colony statistics in grapher.
 - Ability to toggle Grapher plots.
